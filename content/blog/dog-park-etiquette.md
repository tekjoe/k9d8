# Dog Park Etiquette: Do's and Don'ts for Every Visit

Going to the dog park should be fun for everyone — dogs and owners alike. Whether you're a first-timer or a seasoned regular, following basic etiquette keeps the experience safe and enjoyable.

## Before You Go

- **Make sure your dog is up to date on vaccinations.** Most parks require proof of rabies, distemper, and bordetella.
- **Know your dog's temperament.** If your dog gets anxious or reactive around other dogs, work with a trainer before visiting off-leash areas.
- **Bring water and waste bags.** Even if the park provides them, it's good to have your own.

## At the Park

### Do's

- **Keep your eyes on your dog at all times.** Scrolling your phone while your dog plays is a recipe for missed signals.
- **Pick up after your dog immediately.** No one wants to step in surprises.
- **Ask before letting your dog approach another dog.** Not every dog is social, and that's okay.
- **Leave if your dog is being a bully.** Persistent mounting, chasing a scared dog, or resource guarding are signs it's time to go.

### Don'ts

- **Don't bring food or treats into the off-leash area.** This can cause resource guarding and fights.
- **Don't bring a dog in heat.** This creates tension and conflict among other dogs.
- **Don't let small children run and scream.** This can trigger prey drive in some dogs.
- **Don't assume your dog is "friendly."** Every dog has limits. Watch body language.

## Reading Body Language

Learning to read dog body language is the single best thing you can do for park safety:

- **Loose, wiggly body** = happy and relaxed
- **Play bow** (front end down, rear up) = invitation to play
- **Stiff body, hard stare** = tension, potential aggression
- **Tucked tail, ears back** = fear or anxiety
- **Whale eye** (showing whites of eyes) = discomfort

## When Things Go Wrong

If a scuffle breaks out:
1. Stay calm — yelling makes it worse
2. Don't reach between fighting dogs
3. Use a distraction (loud noise, water)
4. Separate the dogs and give them space

## Build Your Park Community

The best dog parks have strong communities. Introduce yourself to other regulars, exchange numbers, and use apps like k9d8 to stay connected. Schedule playdates with dogs your pup gets along with, and you'll both have a better time.
